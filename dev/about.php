            We believe opportunity shouldn't be decided by wealth or reasorces.<br />
            Our goal is to provide intellectual stimulation, free project management, easy learning, and opportunities
            for collaboration.
            Most importantly, this website is free. So join in and have fun.  What have you
            got to lose?<br />
            If you like what we're doing and share our vision, 
            please take the time to donate.<br /> Your contributions will be used to
            improve your experience in drastic ways. With your help, we'll be able to offer more support for our users,
            provide more activities, and add new features. We don't charge money for the services we
            provide. With your help we can keep it that way and have a more efficient website.<br />

            <div id="head">FAQ</div><hr />
            <div id="Q">1. Q: Who is the Infinity Staff?</div>
            <div id="A">A: We are a group of people who want to expand the knowledge available, as well as it's quality. We also want to provide the opportunity of success for anyone who is willing to learn.
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">2. Q: What is the purpose of this website?</div>
            <div id="A">A: In short, Infinity is designed to expand knowledge and collaboration. A place where intellectuals can have discussions, create projects, and even make some money.
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">3. Q: What is the difference between projects and freelancing?</div>
            <div id="A">A: By definition, you could say there is little difference, but at infinity-forum we divide the two. In projects, you reveal the full scope of your plan, can ask for donations, and can provide other incentives for help than money. You can not require work by the hour in a project. In freelancing, you only pay with money, you can pay by the hour or once the work is completed, you cannot request donations to help with your task, and you are not expected to reveal much of the purpose behind the work you are asking. In general, freelancing is better for companies, while projects are better for the average user.
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">4. Q: I hear a lot of talk about "growing" the site. What does that mean, and what does it entail?</div>
            <div id="A">A: As we expand in funds, we will be providing better software for use on the site, as well as optimizing the website itself. Also, funds will be directed towards community projects, challenges, and activities.
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">5. Q: Can I have an example of one of these activities?</div>
            <div id="A">A: Sure! One plan is utilizing funds in order to compete on challenge.gov, where we can submit solutions to government problems and gain prize money for both the site, and those who helped.
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">6. Q: There is no "Challenge.gov" in my country... does that mean I am excluded?</div>
            <div id="A">A: Of course not! That is merely one example of many. Also, there will be community managers in different areas, who's job is to come up with projects for people in that area to work on.
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">7. Q: I hear that the forums are a great way to get to know one another, and make good choices for your projects. That's fine, but I don't think I'll have time to be active on these forums. Is there any way I can still be sure that I am working with trustworthy people?</div>
            <div id="A">A: Of course! You are able to list your qualifications on your profile, and even create a portfolio of your work. Try checking through these to find out if they are who you need. Also, there is an Elite position granted by staff, that will display to the community that you are a great contributor. It is fairly easy to get into this position, all that is required is proof that you are serious, hardworking, and trustworthy.
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">8. Q: Sounds great! If I find that I want to work with Infinity, what positions are there, and how can I get in?</div>
            <div id="A">A: You can be a site admin, moderator, or community manager. You can apply for these positions HERE.
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">9. Q: How many different positions are there and what are they?</div>
            <div id="A">A: There are several different postions you can obtain, and each higher position has the priveleges of all those below them. In ascending order:Guests- Un-registered visitors to the website, Members-Registered users, Frequenters- Members with a significant number of posts, Elites- Members who are individually promoted by proving themselves as trustworthy,great contributors, VIP's-Members who are designated a role in helping others along with projects/topics they are familiar in. You can not apply for this position, we will contact you for it. Moderators(Mods)- Staff members who keep the peace, regualte content, and provide as much help as possible. They have a designated board to manage. Global Moderators(GMods)- Moderators who are able to manage every board. Admins- In addition to the previous roles, they manage the overall site, are very influential and skilled members, and also manage the website at a technical level. They make the big descisions.
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">10. Q: Okay, well, all this sounds great, but what makes you special? Why not a website like Elance, or just another forum?</div>
            <div id="A">A: Happy that you asked. Infinity is special because it allows you to grow as a family, with opportunities for you to learn, as well as create. It is a wonderful experience, being a part of this community. You will gain friends, connections, knowledge, and money. Also, the forums give you an opportunity to communicate with other intellectuals. Most importantly, unlike others, this site is absolutely free!
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">11. Q: That's not enough for me...</div>
            <div id="A">A: Infinity is also the ONLY thing of it's kind with a purpose to support you and your endeavors. We will use funds to advertise your companies, we will form partnerships with you and actively search for ways to advance your company or dream. We will even designate personnel to personally help you along your way. We do not see our clients as mere words on a sheet of paper, but as people.
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">12. Q: I heard that you can make money on this site... how is that?</div>
            <div id="A">A: You can earn cash from helping with other people's projects, with the pay decided by the creator of the project. You can also sign up for a position as site staff and get payed for it. Various community activities will also provide a way to earn money. For example, challenges are a unique way to advance your skills, do some good in the world, and earn cash prizes.
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">13. Q: Okay, but how does Infinity make money?</div>
            <div id="A">A: This site will always be free. We feel that requesting membership fees will hinder the availability of success and knowledge to the populace. Instead, we maintain and expand the website through the donations of our users, and minimal use of ads. If you like what we are doing here, and would like to donate below.
            </div><hr />
            <div id="Q">14. Q: Are you guys a company? Or just a website?</div>
            <div id="A">A: When we recieve enough funds to begin branching out and and doing more things outside of just the website, we will do so. We hope to make Infinity a company that utilizes the expertise of all different fields to create amazing things, and hires based on proven skills rather than solely college information. Most importantly, members who give amazing contributions and stand out in the forums will have a great chance of being hired!
            </div><hr />
